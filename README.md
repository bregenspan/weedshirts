### Why

Why not? But also, I just think it's funny that trademark filers are required to painstakingly describe their designs even when those designs are patently silly ([example](http://weedshirts.biz/tm/butt-naked-toke-game-86361442)). It is not remarkable that someone could get high and produce a goofy and/or bad t-shirt design, but it is interesting that so many do not have second thoughts once they've gone through the exercise of describing that design in detail.
